Preprocessing notes:

The data cleaning and preprocessing was done prior to the splitting of the data.

In practice, while logically impossible data is cleaned out first before partitioning,
Most of the judicious/subjective data cleaning is only done to the training set (because it needs to generalize in prod)
 (idk how we are going to stick to this)
